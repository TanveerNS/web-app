90) what is the difference between for and foreach?

for is expressed as follows:

for (expr1; expr2; expr3)

statement

The first expression is executed once at the beginning. In each iteration, expr2 is evaluated. If it is TRUE, the loop continues, and the statements inside for are executed. If it evaluates to FALSE, the execution of the loop ends. expr3 is tested at the end of each iteration.

However, foreach provides an easy way to iterate over arrays, and it is only used with arrays and objects.

101) Explain whether it is possible to share a single instance of a Memcache between multiple PHP projects?

Yes, it is possible to share a single instance of Memcache between multiple projects. Memcache is a memory store space, and you can run memcache on one or more servers. You can also configure your client to speak to a particular set of instances. So, you can run two different Memcache processes on the same host and yet they are completely independent. Unless, if you have partitioned your data, then it becomes necessary to know from which instance to get the data from or to put into.

102) Explain how you can update Memcached when you make changes to PHP?

When PHP changes you can update Memcached by

Clearing the Cache proactively: Clearing the cache when an insert or update is made
Resetting the Cache: It is similar to the first method but rather than just deleting the keys and waiting for the next request for the data to refresh the cache, reset the values after the insert or update.





Strip_tags() is a function that allows you to strip out all HTML and PHP tags from a given string (parameter one), however you can also use parameter two to specify a list of HTML tags you want. This function can be very helpful if you ever display user input on your site.

The stripslashes() function removes backslashes added by the addslashes() function. This function can be used to clean up data retrieved from a database or from an HTML form.

The strips lashes function enables us to remove the escape characters before apostrophes in a string. stripslashes(string)

addslashes function enables us to escape data before storage into the database.

Add a backslash in front of each double quote (“)  .  The addslashes() function returns a string with backslashes in front of predefined characters. This function can be used to prepare a string for storage in a database and database queries.
